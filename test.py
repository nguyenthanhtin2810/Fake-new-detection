        "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day.He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele - dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump.As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged.He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar.Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election.It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Exactly how much Mr.Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear, the report states.But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr.Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee / Getty Images.",
        "Donald Trump held a rally for Alabama Senate candidate and alleged pedophile Roy Moore in Pensacola, Florida on Friday night which he later claimed was  packed to the rafters  but the venue was barely half-filled with supporters. Outside of the rally, a liberal group targeted the former reality show star and Moore by using Ivanka Trump s own words.American Bridge used a mobile billboard featuring Ivanka Trump s criticism of Moore.  The truck displayed,  There s a special place in hell for people who prey on children  along with Trump s daughter s picture emblazoned across it.Happening now at @realDonaldTrump s rally: we re driving a mobile billboard promoting @IvankaTrump s condemnation of Roy Moore. https://t.co/XpDJYFZjzn #alsen pic.twitter.com/exQIAjZJ05  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) December 9, 2017The group s site says that the quote above and  I have no reason to doubt the victims  accounts  by Ivanka were blasted over a loudspeaker outside of the rally.Watch:We re in Pensacola promoting @IvankaTrump s comments on Roy Moore   pic.twitter.com/NJ3evTw0mw  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) December 9, 2017 There is a special place in hell for people who prey on children,  Ivanka Trump told the Associated Press after Moore s scandal became public.  I ve yet to see a valid explanation, and I have no reason to doubt the victims  accounts. Trump has given Moore his full support despite the Alabama Senate candidate being accused by multilple women of targeting them when they were teenagers and he was in this thirties and working as a district attorney.The truck was reportedly parked across the street from the rally, and was eventually driven around the crowd by American Bridge staffers, The Hill reports.Donald Trump has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by 19 women and yet, conservatives rewarded him by electing him to the highest seat in the land. Right-wing Alabama evangelicals seem to take no issue with Moore s scandalous past, which includes hating Muslims, the LGBTQ community, and allegedly creeping up on young girls.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",
        "We re not sure why Fox News host Sean Hannity posed for this picture (see below) since he s obviously not happy with it but now, Donald Trump s cult member is upset with the New York Times for selecting the photo for the cover of its magazine. Along with the photo, the cover reads,  How Far Will Sean Hannity Go? So @nytimes takes 100 s and 100 s of pics. Obviously they picked the best one?  the Fox News host tweeted to his more than 3.1 million followers.So @nytimes takes 100 s and 100 s of pics.

Loud Asshat  Drain The Trumps (@DrainTheTrumps) November 28, 2017When Donald Trump was the president-elect, he wanted the media to stop publishing unflattering photos of him so naturally, Internet users circulated them quickly. Trump hates photos displaying his many chins. Trump was speaking off-the-record at the time to whine about the unflattering shots. He also complained about photos of himself that NBC used that he found unflattering.At one point, Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness and told her the network won t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing  this picture of me,  as he made a face with a double chin.I hear Donald Trump really hates this photo.

The piece published by the Times was actually a softball interview but Hannity is upset over the photograph.Hannity described himself to the Times as  an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist   I want to give my audiences the best shows possible  and we describe him as a Donald Trump sycophant who has a raging hard-on for Hillary Clinton. While Hannity frequently calls liberals  snowflakes,  he continues to be the snowflakiest Fox News host on TV and on Twitter.Image via screen capture.",
        "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it was set to kick off talks next week with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy, government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year. The expected flurry of legislative activity comes as Republicans and Democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s Republican Party is eager to maintain control of Congress while Democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the Senate and the House of Representatives. On Wednesday, Trump’s budget chief Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan - both Republicans - and their Democratic counterparts, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the White House said. That will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump, McConnell and Ryan on Jan. 6 and 7 at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, according to the White House. The Senate returns to work on Jan. 3 and the House on Jan. 8. Congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its Christmas break, but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by Jan. 19, or the government will shut down. Also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, and by wildfires in California. The House passed an $81 billion package in December, which the Senate did not take up. The White House has asked for a smaller figure, $44 billion. Deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, known as “Dreamers.” In September, Trump ended Democratic former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected Dreamers from deportation and provided work permits, effective in March, giving Congress until then to devise a long-term solution. Democrats, some Republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for DACA protections to continue. Trump and other Republicans have said that will not happen without Congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. Democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by Trump along the U.S.-Mexican border.  “The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,” Trump said in a Twitter post on Friday. Trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the United States. Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he would work with Trump to protect Dreamers. “We can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration for the DREAMers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. If POTUS (Trump) wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise,” Flake wrote on Twitter. Congress in early 2018 also must raise the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The U.S. Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump, who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month, has also promised a major infrastructure plan.",
        "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Callista Gingrich, wife of the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Friday became U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, which is at odds with Washington over immigration, climate change and Jerusalem. Callista Gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to Pope Francis at the Vatican to officially assume her role. Her husband Newt Gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Newt Gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to Fox News from his new base in Rome. Trump’s nomination of Callista Gingrich to the post at the Holy See in May caused some controversy because of her marriage to Gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. Both are Roman Catholic. On Thursday they attended the funeral at the Vatican of Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests.  The pope has implicitly criticized Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris accord on climate change. He said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were “perverse attitudes” that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet. Francis is also opposed to Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The pontiff has called for respect for the city’s “status quo,” saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts.. On Thursday at the United Nations, where the Vatican has permanent observer status, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition. The U.S. embassy said in a statement that the new ambassador “looks forward to working with the Holy See to defend human rights, advance religious freedom, combat human trafficking, and to seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world”."
